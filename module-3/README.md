## Part 1 - Short answer questions



a) Question: `0â€¦5` and`0..<5` are two types of ____________. How are they different?

- Answer: These are two types of range operators.
  - `0...5` uses the closed range operator to define a range that runs from 0 to 5. This means that both the lower and upper bounds are included.
  - `0..<5` uses the half-open range operator to define a range that starts from 0, and goes up to, but does not include 5. This means that the lower bound is included, but not the upper bound.



 b) Question: Describe type inference in Swift and give an example.

- Answer: Type inference in Swift is the ability for the Swift compiler to deduce the data type of a variable or function automatically based on its initialization value or context. When the type is inferred, you do not need to add explicit type annotations. 
- As an example:

```
func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

let result = add(1, 4)
```

- The Swift compiler infers that the type of the constant `result` is an `Int` based on the return type of the `add` function.



c) Question: List three advantages of Playgrounds.

- Answer:

  - Experimenting with code

    - Playgrounds provide an interactive environment for experimenting with Swift code and quickly seeing the results of the code without needing to create an Xcode Project.

  - Documenting learning

    - Playgrounds support markdown which makes it easy and expressive to document Swift code, which makes it a good virtual learning notebook

  - Collaboration and sharing

    - Playgrounds are easy to share with others for review, feedback, and collaboration.

      

d) Question: When does the execution of a while loop end?

- Answer: Until the `while` loop's condition evaluates to `false`.



e) Question: True or False: Tuples in Swift can contain values of different data types.

- Answer: True, tuples in Swift can contain values of different data types. For example:

```
let person: (String, Int, Bool) = ("Nathan", 32, true)
```



 f) Question: List three data types you have used in Swift.

- Answer:
  - Arrays
  - Dictionaries
  - Tuples



g) Question: To execute alternative code when the condition of an `if` statement is not met, you can use what clause?

- Answer: You can use the `else` clause to execute alternative code when the condition of an `if` statement is not met.



h) Question: What is the third element of the array `nums` defined below?  

```
let nums = [5, 0, 44, 20, 1]
```

- The third element is `44` and you would access it using index `2` .



i) Question: An ____________ is a unit of code that resolves to a single value.

- Answer: A function



j) Question: Define two ways to unwrap optionals in Swift.

- 1: Force unwrapping
  - For example:

```
let optionalValue: Int? = 32
let unwrappedValue = optionalValue!
```



- 2: Optional binding
  - For example:

```
// Using if let

let optionalValue: Int? = 32
if let unwrappedValue = optionalValue {
    print(unwrappedValue)
} else {
    print("Optional is nil")
}

// Using guard let

let optionalValue: Int? = 42
guard let unwrappedValue = optionalValue else {
    print("Optional is nil")
    return 
}
```



k) Question: True or False: The condition in an `if` statement must be true or false.

- Answer: True, the condition in an `if` statement must be an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value, which would be either `true` or `false`.



l) Question: Arrays in Swift are ____________ indexed.

- Arrays in Swift are zero-indexed. This means that the first element of an array is `0`, the second element is `1`, and so on. 



m) Question: An unordered collection of unique values of the same type is a _____________.

- Answer: An unordered collection of the same type is called a Set.



## Part 2 - Programming assignment

I have created a Swift playground in `./module-3/Module3.playground` that contains my answers for the assignment.



## Part 3 - Above and Beyond

In the following code:

```
struct Square {
  var side: Int

  func area() -> Int {
    return side * side
  }
}

class Rectangle {
  var length: Int
  var width: Int

  init(length: Int, width: Int) {
    self.length = length
    self.width = width
  }

  func area() -> Int {
    return length * width
  }
}


var square1 = Square(side: 4)
var square2 = square1
square2.side = 5

print("Area: square1 - \(square1.area()) square2 - \(square2.area())")


var rectangle1 = Rectangle(length: 4, width: 4)
var rectangle2 = rectangle1
rectangle2.length = 5

print("Area: rectangle1 - \(rectangle1.area()) rectangle2 - \(rectangle2.area())")
```



Printing the areas of `square1` and `square2` shows:

```
Area: square1 - 16 square2 - 25
```



Printing the area of `rectangle1` and `rectangle2` shows:

```
Area: rectangle1 - 20 rectangle2 - 20
```



The difference in behavior stems from the fact that structs and classes behave differently in Swift. For `rectangle1` and `rectangle2`, both are instances of the `Rectangle` class, which is a reference type. When you assign `rectangle2` the value of `rectangle1`, you are **not** creating a copy. Rather you are creating another reference to the same instance in memory. Therefore, modifying the property of `rectangle2.length` to 5 would also affect `rectangle1.length` because they both reference the same value in the memory location.



On the other hand, for `square1` and `square2`, both are instances of the `Square` struct, which is a value type. When you assign `square2` the value of `square1`, you are creating a distinct copy. Therefore, modifications made to `square2` properties do not affect `square1` and vice versa.
